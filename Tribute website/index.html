            <h2><u>Greatest Martyr</u></h2>
            <p><b>Bhagat Singh </b>was a prominent Indian freedom fighter who played a crucial role in the struggle for India's independence from British rule. Born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab, he was deeply influenced by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the non-cooperation movement. Singh joined the Hindustan Republican Association, later renamed Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, advocating for revolutionary measures. He gained national fame for his involvement in the 1929 bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi, intended as a protest against repressive laws. His trial and subsequent execution by hanging on March 23, 1931, at the age of 23, made him a martyr and an enduring symbol of resistance. Bhagat Singh's writings and actions inspired countless Indians to join the freedom movement, and he remains a revered figure in India's history.
